/*
  Demonstrates the use of a BinnedED. A BinnedED is just a histogram, 
  plus a data representation that tells it where to look in an event.
  
  We first define the binning, then use it to create a BinnedED. Set the 
  data representation, and then call the pdf on a plain vector input, and 
  to evaluate the probability of an event.
